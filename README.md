# Project Mentality
(Python, Automation, Mobile-Integration, Web scrapping)
The “Project Mentality” is an automated program designed to deliver daily curated quotes from famous thinkers to the user’s phone via SMS. Its main purpose is to provide motivation and inspiration for personal improvement on a daily basis.

The program employs web scraping techniques to gather quotes from various online sources such as websites, blogs, and social media platforms. The scraped data undergoes analysis and data cleaning processes to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the quotes, eliminating any errors or inconsistencies.

Using Python, the program is automated to deploy daily and send the curated quotes directly to the user’s phone as SMS messages. This automation is achieved by integrating APIs or third-party services that enable sending SMS messages from a Python script. By integrating with SMS gateway providers, the program ensures seamless delivery of the curated quotes, providing a convenient and accessible user experience.

Furthermore, the project involves learning advanced techniques for automated web deployment. This includes setting up a reliable hosting environment using containerization technologies like Docker and leveraging cloud platforms such as AWS or Google Cloud for efficient scaling and management.

In summary, the “Project Mentality” is an automated program that delivers daily curated quotes to the user’s phone via SMS. Through web scraping, data cleaning, and mobile integration, it aims to motivate users and inspire personal growth. The project also emphasizes learning advanced techniques for automated web deployment to ensure smooth operation and scalability.
